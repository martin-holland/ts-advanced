# Typescript Advanced

## Things to know:

- The tsconfig file can be generated from tsc --init
- This can be used to include watch mode and excludes
- Exclude will automatically ignore any node modules, but you can also explicitly put them in as per the demonstration in this project.
- Contains a exclude.ts file to demonstrate this.
- "include": ["filenames"] can be used to do the opposite of exclude.
